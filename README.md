# Media-Organizer
Problem: When I upload photos from my phone's camera roll to another folder on my laptop, I like to organize them by the month and year they were taken. However, I must manually do this myself.

Solution: In this program, I can provide a path to a folder with the contents of my camera roll (photos, videos, etc.), and if the path is valid, then the program will execute and organize the contents into their respective folders formatted {Month Year}.
